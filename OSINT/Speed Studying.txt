Help, I'm studying for a test, and I need you to find an example problem for me... I'm sure you can find it out there somewhere! I'm trying to remember this professor's name but I'm having trouble...who is the only professor at UC San Diego that is both an Assistant Professor for the Computer Science department, and an Associate Professor for the Mathematics department?
Note
The flag is not in the usual sdctf{} format. Submit that professor's First and Last name (but not the middle name, if any) separated by a single space. For example, if the professor has first name John and last name Appleseed, then...
Please Submit
John Appleseed
