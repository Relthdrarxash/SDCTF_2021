Nice, now that you've found Daniel Kane, I need an example from one of his classes. I don't remember anything about it other than its called "The Skyline Problem". Can you find it?

------------------------------------------

This one is way more tricky,
After looking into the papers courses, much time has passed and nothing came up.

Though, I had the idea to use dorks on his website http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane
and I found more courses than there were.

So I decided to pull up site:cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane skyline
skyline being the keyword about it, I found a link to a homework paper : Homework3.pdf

the flag is at the bottom of the page :
